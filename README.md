# Intel 8080 Architecture Emulator

## What is the Intel 8080?
The Intel 8080 is one of the first 8-bit microprocessors ever created, and the second created by Intel after the 4004. It was widely implemented in many computer systems as a processor. It was further developed into the 8085, 8086, and then to the x86 architecture that is now ubiquitous.

## Why make an Intel 8080 emulator?
The Intel 8080 is a popular beginner's system for writing emulators, due to its simplicity and the fact that other processors mimic its design. For example, the Nintendo Gameboy uses an architecture similar to the 8080, so I would be practiced at future development by writing an Intel 8080 emulator.

## Why Python?
Python is the language I am most comfortable writing in, so for a first attempt at an emulator I wanted to use it. Python is not commonly used for writing emulators since they are often slow to run; languages like C, C++, and Rust are generally preferred. At the time of this writing, I do not know C++ and Rust, and I am not comfortable coding in C. However, the Intel 8080 is simple enough where Python can be used without causing massive performance issues.

## Development
The emulator currently only exists as a skeleton and is unusable.
